ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In LivroAndroidCap18-Sms:
* AndroidManifest.xml => livroAndroidCap18Sms/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => livroAndroidCap18Sms/src/main/res/
* src/ => livroAndroidCap18Sms/src/main/java/
In LivroAndroidCap09-BroadcastReceiver:
* AndroidManifest.xml => livroAndroidCap09BroadcastReceiver/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => livroAndroidCap09BroadcastReceiver/src/main/res/
* src/ => livroAndroidCap09BroadcastReceiver/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
